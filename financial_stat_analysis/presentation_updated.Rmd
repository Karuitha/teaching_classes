class: left, middle

# Liquidity Ratios

### The current ratio is among the most useful in this area. 

### Reflects abililty of a firm to pay its obligations in the short term. 

$Current Ratio = \frac{Current Assets}{Current Liabilities}$

- A current ratio of at least 2 is healthy.

- However, the threshold may vary by industry.

# Leverage Ratios

### Debt ratio

$Debt Ratio = \frac{Total Liabilties}{Total Assets}$

- A debt ratio of between 50 and 60% is standard.
- Again, this varies by industry and other factors.

# Main Take Aways from the Regression

- Age, operating expenses to assets ratio, donations to assets ratio, asset structure and size are the key drivers of gross loans to assets ratio.

- Older MFIs have higher gross loans to assets ratio.

- Operating expenses relates positively with gross loans to assets ratios.

- Donations have a negative relationship with gross loans to assets.

- Both asset structure and size of an MFI have negative relationship with the size of an MFI. 

---

# Conclusion

### The conversion of MFIs could negatively affect financial inclusion in Africa.

### NGOs have reach more women borrowers than banks, NBFIs, rural banks and credit unions.

### NGOs have lower average loan balance per borrower than other MFI legal forms.

### NGOs the second highest median gross loans behind credit unions.
